Either press the "Build Colliders" button on the "Isometric Tilemap Auto Collider" component at the Grid object, or press play to generate the colliders.

All of the tilemaps in these scenes are created using my other asset "Procedural Isometric Map Generator" which can be found at https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/procedural-isometric-map-generator-181280
